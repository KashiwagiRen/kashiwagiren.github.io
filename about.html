            <h1>About Project 残響</h1>
            <p>
              This is just a little project of mine which made me in awe when finished
              and my first website.

              This was created by Kieth Wilbur J. Chua - 1st year Computer Engineering Student. 
              He is inspired by some nice websites which has a great interface and graphic designs 
              and decided to make his own in reference to the various websites he was inpired to.
